    "Whole Wheat Pancakes" sourced from <a

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>⅔ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>⅓ cup wheat germ</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>5⅓ tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2½ cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a food processor or in a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, white flour, wheat germ or oats,
            baking powder, baking soda, brown sugar, and salt.</li>
        <li>Cut the butter into small pieces with a knife, and add the butter to the flour-mixture. Mix until the
            mixture has a sand-like consistency.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the center of the flour-butter mixture, and add the buttermilk and eggs. Stir until the
            liquids are fully incorporated.</li>
        <li>Heat a frying pan over medium heat and grease the surface with 1 tablespoon of butter or oil. Ladle the
            batter onto the surface to form 4 inch pancakes. Once bubbles form on the top of the pancakes, flip them
            over, and cook them on the other side for about 2 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
